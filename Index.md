## Bootstrap Logging

Monitoring any service should be a priority for every development team, especially during the startup phase. Consequently, I aim to promptly identify any potential errors occurring upon the service's initiation by logging them for further auditing and leveraging any system that facilitates alerts.

The susggested implementation incorporates Serilog and Azure Application Inights.
